## âš¡ About Me :

I am a Fullstack web devloper with 1 year of expeience, and I am very interested in the web field.
I worked in two software companies: Multiscore company, Perfect Solutions Company ( Currently working there ).
One of my main goals for the next year is to become a JavaScript Fullstack developer.
My goals for the coming period are many. 
I wish I could achieve many things from them, why not all of them, but it takes time, learning and patience.
